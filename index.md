title: Bacterial Bomb Model
---
Boom! There has been an explosion of bacteria in the area,
and it is important to estimate how this will spread.

The model will predict the density based on random movement
for the bacteria particles, taking into account the effects of 
the wind. 

The spread will then be displayed and written to an output file 
ready to analyse further from the models' predictions. 

All the necessary files are available from the repository [here](https://studid-201465981.github.io/GEOG5003_Assignment2_Bacterial_Bomb_201465981.github.io/)
Please open the README file first to understand the model and recieve specific user instructions.
